## Question:

#### Complete the function `printNumber` which takes an integer input from the user and prints it on the screen.

Use:

* For C++ : `cout << variable_name;`
* For Java : `System.out.print();`
* For Python : `print()`
* For JavaScript : `console.log()`

 

## Approach:

The idea is to take an integer input from the user and print it on the screen.
This task can be broken down into the following steps:

1. **Receive Input**: Capture the integer input from the user.
2. **Print the Input**: Output the captured integer to the screen.

Use an input function to get the user's input. Return the input integer as per requirement.

 

## Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    # Function to take input and display output 
    def printNumber(self):
        # Take input
        number = int(input())
        
        # Print output
        print(number)
```
